# Cloning Repositories

Add an existing project to your local workpace by cloning its repository from Git.

1.  Open a terminal.

2.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

3.  Type `git clone`, and then paste your URL.

2. Paste the URL in the input box.

3. Select the folder to clone the repository location from the popup.

4. Enter the credentials in the input box, if prompted.
