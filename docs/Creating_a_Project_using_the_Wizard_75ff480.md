# Creating a Project Using the Wizard

You can create projects based on your development scenario and the extensions installed in the dev space using predefined templates.

1.  Open the wizard in one of the following ways:

    -   Go to *File* \> *New Project from Template*.
    -   Select *Start from template* from the Welcome page.
    -   Enter ***New Project*** in the command palette and select *SAP Business Application Studio: New Project from Template*.

    The Project Wizard opens showing the project templates that are relevant based on the dev space and additional extensions that you selected.

2.  Follow the wizard steps and provide the required information. You can move between steps using the *Previous* and *Next* buttons or clicking the steps from the wizard tree.

    The wizard displays error notifications on the field level and on the step level.

3.  If you already have an open workspace, at the conclusion of the wizard, choose whether you want to open the project in a new workspace or add it to the existing one, thus moving to multi-root mode.

The wizard generates the project including the relevant folder structure, artifacts, and resources.
