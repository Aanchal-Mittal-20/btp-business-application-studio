# Storyboard

The Storyboard, together with the project explorer for CAP, helps you to develop large parts of your CAP application using modeling and graphical editors.



To open the Storyboard, select your project in the *CAP DATA MODELS AND SERVICES* section, and click *Open with Storyboard* from the context menu.



## Using the Graphical Editor

The Storyboard allows you to develop using graphical editors and wizards.

It provides a graphical view of the data models, services, and UI front ends of the application, as well as the connections between them. This allows for a quick understanding of the applicationâ€™s structure and components.

You can move, zoom in and out, and expand and collapse single objects or all objects at once.

You can also filter objects to focus on the application components that are relevant for you.
